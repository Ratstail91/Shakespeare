# Introduction

God.

Spirit.

Ghost.

You're not quite any of these things.

You're more like an observer of sorts - you exist outside of this world.

That doesn't mean you're entirely detached, or totally heartless. Indeed, you find the people in this world to be quite fascinating.

You watch them, sometimes, as they go about their lives, doing the things you can't. Very occasionally, you will tip the scales of luck, or pluck at the threads of fate, just to see how they would react.

On this day, you lazily observe a young gentlemen, a highschooler by the looks of things, running alongside a road.

Boy "Crap, crap, crap!" He thinks to himself.

Boy "Please let me reach the bus in time! I can't be late again!"

# The bus arrives on time

The boy rounds the last corner before the bus stop, just in time to see the bus speeding away.

The boy, defeated, stops to take a breath.

Boy "I've done it again... teach won't let me off easy this time."

Taking a deep breath to slow his heartbeat, he resigns himself to walk the rest of the way to school.

Just as he sets off down the road, you hear another flustered stream of thoughts moving down the next alleyway.

Girl "Crap, crap, crap!" a girl this time, also dressed in the high school's uniform, and carrying a slice of toast between her teeth.

Girl "I've missed the bus! How did I sleep in on my first day?"

You watch, as the two threads of fate draw closer...

*BANG*

Before the boy knows what happened, the girl rounds the alley corner and rams into him. Falling to the ground, they're both stunned for a moment.

The girl quickly gathers her thoughts, and jumps to her feet.

Girl "Sorry!" She yells, as she jets down the street, slightly limping at first, before recovering.

The boy watches on while pulling his own thoughts together.

Boy "Ow."

He drags himself to his feet, now with a small streaks of jam across his shirt.

Boy "Well, today couldn't get much worse." He says aloud, while internally he makes a wish that it doesn't.

The boy brushes himself off as best he can, and sets off down the street at a brisk pace.

You decide, out of curiosity, to follow the boy.

# The bus is running late

You decide to take pity on the boy, and gently move his thread of fate. As you do, however, you notice that it crosses someone else's thread.

The boy rounds the last corner before the bus stop, and feels a sense of relief.

The boy, triumphant, stops to take a breath.

Boy "Thank god" he whispers. You accept the praise.

Taking a deep breath to slow his heartbeat, he watches up the street for the approaching bus.

As he waits, you hear another flustered stream of thoughts moving down the next alleyway.

Girl "Crap, crap, crap!" a girl this time, also dressed in the high school's uniform, and carrying a slice of toast between her teeth.

Girl "I've missed the bus! How did I sleep in on my first day?"

You watch, as the two threads of fate draw closer...

She comes to a stop beside the boy, panting around the slice of toast, just as the bus pulls up to the curb.

Boy "Wow, a bit of a cliche with the toast." he thinks to himself, as he gives her a friendly smile.

The girl, flustered, can only swallow a chunk before giving a friendly nod in return.

They both board the crowded bus, and take their seats as it pulls away.

You decide, out of curiosity, to follow the bus.

# Arrive at school late

The boy finally arrives at what you assume is his classroom.

Boy "I'm sorry I'm late, teacher!" he says in earnest, as he slips into the room.

He is met with a number of incredulous looks from the other students.

Teacher "Satoshi, please sit down. Consider this your last warning."

You could feel the frustation coming from the teacher.

Curious, you peek into the teacher's mind. It seems the they consider this Satoshi to be rather intelligent, but lazy.

Satoshi hurries to his seat. Only then does he see an oddly familiar face - the girl he ran into earlier!

Teacher "As I was saying, before I was rudely interrupted, we have a new student here today."

# Arrive at school on time

The boy and girl go their separate ways after disembarking the bus - the girl, to the front office, and the boy, to what you assume is his classroom.

THe boy has time to settle into his chair, as the teacher seems to be out of the room at first.

However, just as the first bell rang, the door opened to admit a stern looking teacher, followed by an oddly familiar face - the girl he had seen at the bus stop earlier!

Teacher "Good morning class!"

The students responded with a half-hearted good morning, much to the teacher's chagrin.

Teacher "I said, good morning class!"

This time, a more enthusiastic response.

The teacher's sharp eyes picked out the boy, as you felt a touch of humour run through his mind.

Teacher "Satoshi."

Satoshi "Y-Yes sir!" the boy responded, suddenly wishing he had been late after all.

Teacher "Well done on making it to class on time." This elicited a number of soft chuckles from the class.

Satoshi "Y-Yes sir!"

Curious, you peek into the teacher's mind. It seems the they consider this Satoshi to be rather intelligent, but lazy.

Teacher "Now then. We have a new student here today."

[jump] Aiko

# Aiko

Teacher "Please, introduce yourself."

The girl stepped forward, and took a deep breath. Her mind is giving off a degree of nervousness that her body is hiding quite well.

Aiko "Hello everyone, my name is Aiko." a moment passes.

Aiko "I'm transferring in from Tokyo, it's a pleasure to meet you all." She bows, and considers if there's anything else she should say.

A flurry of thoughts pour from the class - many of them consider her be quite beautiful, with at least two of the boys imagining how to confess their undying love to her.

You find it hard to pick out which thought is coming from which student - a common problem with crowds.

After a moment, the teacher breaks the silence.

Teacher "I'm sure your classmates will do their best to make you feel right at home."

Teacher "Please take a seat."

The only free seat in the class happens to be next to Satoshi. As Aiko sits beside him, you can see, almost clear as day, their threads of fate crossing once again.

Not for the first time, you wonder if there's been some powerful entity tampering with the fates of humans.
